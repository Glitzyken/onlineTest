# onlineTest
Computer Based Test App using Javascript

1) I designed an earlier CBT in jQuery https://papa28x4.github.io/cbt/  but for this one I decided to put my JS skill to test. If ain't vanilla, I ain't lickingðŸ˜‹

2) All the questions are no longer displayed on one page. The questions are now served to the user one after the other

3) You're not limited to one exam. User now has a choice to sit for either English, Maths or GNS. A drop down menu has been provided for that purpose.

4) I decided to be evil and implemented negative marking. If you don't know, leave it blank but if you guess and get it wrong you will be penalizedðŸ˜œ

5) Ideally, an exam should be time bound. Hence, I included a timer.

6) A review button is provided at the end of the test. Click on it to see answers(and explanations where necessary) to the test you just took.
